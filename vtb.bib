   abstract  = "Live streaming has become increasingly popular, with most
                streamers presenting their real-life appearance. However,
                Virtual YouTubers (VTubers), virtual 2D or 3D avatars that are
                voiced by humans, are emerging as live streamers and attracting
                a growing viewership in East Asia. Although prior research has
                found that many viewers seek real-life interpersonal
                interactions with real-person streamers, it is currently unknown
                what makes VTuber live streams engaging or how they are
                perceived differently than real-person streamers. We conducted
                an interview study to understand how viewers engage with VTubers
                and perceive the identities of the voice actors behind the
                avatars (i.e., Nakanohito). The data revealed that Virtual
                avatars bring unique performative opportunities which result in
                different viewer expectations and interpretations of VTuber
                behavior. Viewers intentionally upheld the disembodiment of
                VTuber avatars from their voice actors. We uncover the nuances
                in viewer perceptions and attitudes and further discuss the
                implications of VTuber practices to the understanding of live
                streaming in general.",
